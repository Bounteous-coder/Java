This project involves designing a program to create safe and optimal bike paths within a newly proposed National Park around Pyramid Creek Falls Provincial Park in British Columbia. 
The park is modeled as interconnected hexagonal chambers, each with varying levels of safety based on light exposure and terrain type. 
Chambers include lighted, dim, sealed, dark, and treasure chambers, with each type affecting path feasibility. 
The goal is to develop an algorithm that identifies safe paths from the entrance to all treasure chambers, avoiding sealed and dark chambers while prioritizing treasure chambers and well-lit routes. 
This program aims to enhance park accessibility while ensuring visitor safety by navigating complex terrain and hazardous areas effectively.
